# AI Software Factory — Project Milestone Plan

# Current Handover Snapshot

Repository: `tehkst/ai-app-builder-dev`

Current merged baseline after PR #105: `8e470eb V78 — Self-Build Module Request Flow (#105)`

Current completed milestone: V78 — Self-Build Module Request Flow

Current active next milestone: V79 — Module Rollout Gate

Primary product direction:

Build the minimum self-building and self-healing app factory loop:

Generate app/module files -> write approved files to sandbox -> run approved app in sandbox -> capture logs/errors -> analyze failure -> propose repair -> approve repair -> apply repair -> re-run -> roll out passing module.

Near-term checkpoints:

- V70 — first controlled sandbox app run. Complete.
- V71 — runtime log capture. Complete.
- V72 — runtime failure analysis. Complete.
- V73 — repair plan generation. Complete.
- V74 — repair approval gate. Complete.
- V75 — repair executor. Complete.
- V76 — re-run after repair. Complete.
- V77 — first complete self-healing loop. Complete.
- V78 — self-build module request flow. Complete.
- V79 — module rollout gate.
- V80 — first self-built module rollout.

Current safety boundary:

Controlled runtime execution, runtime log capture, classification-only runtime failure analysis, plan-only repair plan generation, approval-only repair gating, approval-gated sandbox repair execution, re-run-after-repair coordination, first self-healing loop coordination, and request-tracking-only self-build module requests are now implemented for approved runtime plans inside the approved sandbox only. V79 may add a rollout eligibility and approval gate for generated modules, but must not perform actual rollout execution yet. V79 must not auto-approve rollout, auto-apply repairs, restore files, roll out modules, install packages beyond already approved runtime plans, or broaden runtime execution beyond the approved sandbox boundary.

This file is the source of truth for the current development roadmap.

## Planning Rule

Do not insert, rename, reorder, or replace milestones without explicit user confirmation.

If a new milestone is useful, add it first under **Optional / Backlog Milestones** and explain why it may be needed. Only move it into the active roadmap after approval.

## Project Working Rule

Use the direct GitHub connection for every step the assistant can safely handle, including repository inspection, branch creation, file creation, file updates, commits, PR creation, PR updates, PR review/status inspection, and PR merging.

Only involve the local Mac workflow when direct GitHub access cannot perform the step or when local validation is required. The user's local role should normally be limited to `git pull` / branch sync, running validation commands, pasting terminal output, and resolving local environment issues.

Do not ask for VS Code/manual file editing unless the user explicitly requests it. Prefer GitHub-side commits and PRs first, then local sync/test.

## Current Completed Milestone

### V78 — Self-Build Module Request Flow

Status: Completed and merged via PR #105.

V78 added request-tracking-only self-build module request flow. It can create, normalize, list, fetch, link, and inspect handoff for module requests. Linked requests can read existing V77 self-healing loop status by workflow_run_id. V78 does not create workflows, write generated files, execute generated code, start runtimes, install packages, apply repairs, auto-approve, restore files, or roll out modules.

## Active Next Milestone

### V79 — Module Rollout Gate

Status: Active next milestone.

Goal: add a module rollout eligibility and approval gate for generated/self-built modules. V79 should determine whether a linked module request appears eligible for rollout based on request metadata and V77 handoff status, expose rollout approval/rejection records and history, and show rollout gate status in API/dashboard. V79 must be gate-only. It must not execute rollout, copy files to production, modify live modules, auto-approve rollout, bypass V70-V78 approvals, restore files, install packages, or broaden runtime execution permissions.

Current product limitation:

The system can now generate files, detect runtime readiness, build a run plan, require runtime approval, write approved files to the sandbox, start an approved sandbox runtime, capture runtime stdout/stderr/exit logs, classify runtime failures, generate repair plans, approve or reject repair plans, check repair apply gates, execute approved sandbox-bound repair operations, re-run after successful repair, compare before/after runtime status/log metadata, coordinate the first approval-preserving self-healing loop, and track self-build module requests. A rollout eligibility and approval gate is not implemented yet and is the V79 focus.

---

## Not Done Yet / Focused Future Work

The project should now avoid broad feature expansion until the self-building/self-healing loop is working.

Focused pending areas:

- Module rollout gate.
- First internal dogfooding module.

Deferred until after the loop works:

- Drag-and-drop app builder.
- Marketplace, templates, and plugins.
- Multi-user product/team layer.
- External deployment/export connectors.
- Advanced workflow builder.

## Recommended Roadmap Toward Self-Building and Self-Healing App Factory

## Primary Product Direction

The main objective is to build a live self-building and self-healing app factory.

The platform should become capable of generating small app modules, writing them into a controlled sandbox, running them only after explicit approval, observing runtime failures, planning repairs, applying approved repairs, and re-running until the module works.

The near-term priority is not to manually build every product feature. The priority is to build the loop that lets the app safely build, test, repair, and roll out modules.

Target checkpoints:

- First controlled sandbox app run reached by V70.
- Runtime log capture reached by V71.
- Runtime failure analysis reached by V72.
- Repair plan generation reached by V73.
- Repair approval gate reached by V74.
- Repair executor reached by V75.
- Re-run after repair reached by V76.
- First self-healing repair loop reached by V77.
- Self-build module request flow reached by V78.
- Reach first self-built module rollout by V80.

Minor V-number milestones may be inserted when implementation gaps are discovered, but every inserted milestone must belong to this self-building/self-healing direction, preserve existing safety boundaries unless explicitly expanded, include smoke/preservation checks, and be completed before the next milestone starts.

## Next Chat Startup Instructions

When continuing in a new chat, start by verifying the latest `main` branch and this file.

Required first commands:

    cd /Users/toniteh/Desktop/ai-app-builder-dev
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    git log --oneline -5
    grep -n "Current Handover Snapshot\|Project Working Rule\|Active Next Milestone\|V79 — Module Rollout Gate\|V80" docs/PROJECT_MILESTONE_PLAN.md
    git status

Then begin only the active next milestone:

V79 — Module Rollout Gate

Before coding V79, inspect:

    sed -n '1,260p' app/platform/services/self_build_module_request_service.py
    sed -n '1,260p' app/platform/services/self_healing_loop_coordinator_service.py
    grep -n "module-requests\|self-healing-loop\|workflowRunId" app/platform/api/app_build_routes.py | sed -n '1,520p'

V79 must add rollout eligibility and approval gate only. It must not execute rollout, copy files to production, modify live modules, auto-approve rollout, bypass V70-V78 approvals, restore files, install packages, or broaden runtime execution permissions.

---

## Standard Validation Reminder

Every milestone should continue to include:

- Syntax check.
- Milestone-specific smoke check.
- Previous browser-stage smoke checks where relevant.
- Function registry check for internal module/function breakage.
- Dependency warning check for dependency/package/deprecation warnings.
